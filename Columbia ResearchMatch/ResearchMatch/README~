ResearchMatch
-------------

ResearchMatch is an open source Web application written in Rails 3 designed
to facilitate the matching of students (in particular, but not necessarily,
undergraduate students) to research positions offered by faculty at
university. ResearchMatch uses tags and user-specified parameters to
suggest research positions for students, manages the application to jobs
by students and allows for the submission of a resume and/or transcript
in the research application.
