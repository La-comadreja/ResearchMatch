Feature: A user should have an administrator role with admin privileges

  As an admin
  So that I can belong to a group distinct from the existing groups, but have privileges to perform administrative tasks.
  I want to be able to make any changes to listings as if I were an owner and to update roles of existing users (one user at a time) overwriting the roles provided by the default authorization system.

  Scenario: Admin should be able to edit someone else's posting.
    Given I am signed in with provider "cas" as Fox
    And I go to the home page
    Then I should see "Logged in as Armando Fox"
    And I follow "Post a Listing"
    When I fill in "Listing title" with "titletitletitle"
    And I select "Armando Fox" from "faculty_id"
    And I fill in "Listing description" with "descriptiondescriptiondescriptiondescriptiondescriptiondescriptiondescription"
    And I press "Post"
    Then I should see "Thank your for submitting a listing."
