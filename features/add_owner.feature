Feature: A faculty user should be able to add owners to a listing.

  As a faculty user
  So that I can allocate listing management to grad students / other faculty
  I want to be able to add owners to a listing with permissions equal to mine (added
  owners can accept applicants and edit the listing following the same steps as the
  original owner)

  Background: Create a posting and add a faculty co-owner.
